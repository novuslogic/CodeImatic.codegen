XML Documentation in code is a set of comments that provide additional information about the code. It is used to document the code so that other developers can understand what the code does and how it works. XML Documentation typically includes descriptions of classes, methods, properties, and parameters. It can also include examples of how to use the code, notes on any known issues, and other helpful information
